## üîéOverview

<!-- #### Current Business Scenario -->
> This workshop is all about RAP fundamentals; especially about how to use RAP core features when building greenfield implementations.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  
In this hands-on session we will guide you through the development of the OData service of a SAP Fiori elements based _Travel Processing App_ with RAP, using the _managed_ business object (BO) runtime implementation with semantic key and internal unmanaged early numbering. We will give you more details on the scenario in the different exercises.

The resulting app will look like this:

![Travel App](exercises/images/rap100_travelapp01.png)

The OData service you are going to implement is based on the _ABAP Flight Reference Scenario_. To set the business context, the scenario is the following: The department responsible for managing worldwide Travels for multiple Agencies is requesting you to build a new Fiori app with draft capabilities for processing (i.e. creating, updating and deleting) Travels.

Below is the simplified data model underlying the app.

![Travel App](exercises/images/rap100_datamodel01.png)

> **Please note**:   
> The purpose of the different exercises is to show you how to implement the different RAP core features - and less on having the perfect business scenario.
> To remove a certain complexity in the implementation, we will use a very simplified data model with only one BO node, the _Travel_ entity.   
> For implementation examples with more than one BO node, you can have a look at:
> - RAP Development Guide on the SAP Help Portal: **[Develop Applications](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/4cff5dff7f2642cab54e993c840a163e.html)**
> - Workshop **[RAP110](https://github.com/SAP-samples/abap-platform-rap110)**

</details>


## üõ†Exercises
[^Top of page](#)

Follow these steps to build an OData service on top of a draft-enabled RAP Business Object (BO) to develop a transactional, draft-enabled Fiori elements List Report app from scratch using RAP. You will also write an ABAP unit test for it and explore the Entity Manipulation Language (EML).

#### Beginner Level

<!--
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Skip the _Getting Started_ exercise and start directly with [Exercise 1](exercises/ex01/README.md) 
-->

#### Intermediate Level
The exercises below are based on the exercise 1 to 5 from the _Beginner Level_ section.

| Exercises | -- |
| ------------- |  -- |
| [Exercise 6: Enhance the BO Behavior ‚Äì Actions](exercises/ex06/README.md) | -- |

#### Additional Exercises: 
The following exercises are based on the Exercises 1-9 from the _Beginner_ and _Intermediate Level_ sections.   
However, you can perform these exercises in the given order already after _Exercise 1_ if you want to test the result of the following exercises directly in the real SAP Fiori elements-based _Travel_ app instead of using the ADT preview.

## About the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model
[^Top of page](#)

> The **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** is at the heart of the ABAP Cloud development model (ABAP Cloud) for implementing transactional scenarios.
> 
> **ABAP Cloud** is the new ABAP development model for building innovative and cloud-ready business apps, services, and extensions that adhere to the principles of clean core extensibility on all SAP S/4HANA editions, both in the cloud and on-premise, as well as on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP).

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>

The _ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model_ (RAP) is an enabler for improving the user experience and innovating business processes in ABAP-based SAP solutions by leveraging SAP Fiori, SAP HANA, and the cloud. 

RAP offers a set of concepts, tools, languages, and powerful frameworks for efficiently building cloud-ready, transactional SAP Fiori apps, web APIs, and local APIs in the cloud and on-premise. It is a long-term strategic solution for ABAP development on SAP‚Äôs flagship product SAP S/4HANA, in the cloud and on-premise (as of release 1909), as well as on the SAP BTP ABAP Environment.

The illustration below shows the high-level end-to-end development stack when working with RAP.
